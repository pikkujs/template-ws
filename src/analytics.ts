 * What this app can measure — add a key when you add an event. This is the
 * input schema of both `POST /analytics` and `services.analytics.record()`, so
 * an undeclared name fails to compile and is rejected at the wire.
 *
 * Measure outcomes rather than clicks, and keep props low-cardinality: they
 * become queryable columns, and identity is already stamped server-side.
 *
 * With nothing wired the events are logged; set `analyticsService` in
 * `services.ts` to send them elsewhere.
