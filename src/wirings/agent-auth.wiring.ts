/**
 * A bearer token that stands in for a signed-in user on the agent demo.
 *
 * Agent threads are owned by the session principal. A request with no session
 * gets an ephemeral owner that is minted per request and never reused, so a
 * sessionless caller cannot come back to a thread it created a moment ago — by
 * design, because otherwise anyone could reach any thread by naming its id. The
 * agent clients need memory across turns, so they need a session.
 *
 * The token is read from a secret rather than written here: an unset secret
 * leaves the middleware inert, which is the right default for a template
 * somebody copies. `run-tests.sh` exports a fresh value for the server and the
 * client together.
